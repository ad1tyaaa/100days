# Logs of Round 1

> #100DaysOfCode

## day 1 : 21 july 2023

**Progress :** Started revision of C++ basics from the beginning. Wrote a few basic programs as well. And, revised a few important theory topics.

Important Topics : 
- `char` datatype (ASCII and extended ASCII representation of `char` and `unsigned char`)
- *Storing* and *Reading* positive and negative numbers in memory
- `bool` type (reprentation, and **Negation** behavior).

**Final Thought:** I've done C++ before, so this is basically revision. Mostly i only did boring stuff today, but, I'm happy for completing day1. üòå

## day 2 : 22 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Operators (including Bitwise that took some time), then moved onto conditional statements, and loops, and finally solved some 10-15 problems (easy ones) on them.

Important Topics :
- Important Bitwise Operations and their rules and tricks.

**Final Thought:** Hmmm, honestly I feel bad for today's progress. I think I covered quite less than what I intended. I also couldn't really focus very well. I have an important report that I have to work on and I spent most of the time getting scared abut how I'm going to finish it on time. üò¢

## day 3 : 23 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Bitwise Shift Operators (i forgot to study it yesterday), Functions, Memory layout of C, switch statement, and solved a few basic problems of Functions. Solved an easy problem from LeetCode as well.

Important Topics :
- Result of applying `>>` (right shift operator) on **negative** numbers, (*it makes them positive numebrs*).
- Memory layout in C / C++.

**Final Thought:** So, today i think I somewhat managed to finished the intended topics, although I counldn't solve coding problems from platforms like LeedCode, etc. I wanted to solve quite a few problems, but, as I sat down for this very late, I'm probably gonna solve problems tomorrow the whole time. I'm still feeling good though, as now I have finally completed Basics of C++, and I can start Data Structures from 25th. üôÉ

## day 4 : 24 july 2023

**Progress :** Solved problems from Leetcode, GFG, and CodeStudio. That's It.

**Final Thoughts :** It feels irritating when when u can't solve a problem bucause u made a mistake so small that u had to stare at the screen for 20+ mins to find it. LeetCode #7 and #1009 kind of irritated me. But, I finally managed to solve them, and all other ones too. So, I guess it wasn't that bad afterall. Tomorrow I will finally be starting DSA. And, DSA is the part that I have left in the middle a few too many times in the past. Hopefully I don't do it again this time. üêº

> I didn't do anything for last few days... üò¢
<br> I was working on that godamn project report. üò≠üò≠üò≠
<br> Finally it's over, so now i'll focus on it from tomorrow again. ü´§

## day 5 : 31 july 2023

**Progress :** Started Arrays (the first data structure). Solved a few problems, and did Linear Search too. Couldn't do Binary Search today. Will do that tomorrow.

**Final Thoughts :** I'm back. Finally... <br> I ended up taking a long break, almost a week, and now, I'm starting it again. Today i did Arrays. It's still a revision so I don't find it tough really. I did till Linear search today, didn't have enought time to cover Binary Search too. Will complete that tomorrow. Honestly, I feel like shit for taking such a long break. üò£

## day 6 : 2 august 2023

**Progress :** Continued on with Arrays, and did Binary Search. Also, solved a few problems. I found out that we can use XOR operations to swap 2 numbers. I didn't know that.

Important Topics :
- Different ways to `swap()` two numbers.
- Binary Search Optimization for dealing with *overflow case*.

**Final Thoughts :** I skipped again yesterday. And, I'll have to skip the next few days as well as I'm going out of station, and I won't have my laptop. So, I'll probably be back once I return in a few days. As, for today I ended Binary Search. I wanted to do Complexity Analysis as well, but, I thought it would be better to do it after I return. I don't want to go on a break just after studying that. üêº

## day 7 : 9 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a basic revision of Arrays, and Searching Algorithms. And started vectors. Couldn't finish vectors today.

Important Topics :
- `memset()` function
- Designated Initialization

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm, I have returned back home, and resumed DSA today. I started Vectors today, and well, I'm struggling. Not because it's tough, but, idk. I'm finding sitting and coding for more than an hour tough. I feel like stopping and watching youtube or something when I code. I initially wanted to complete Algorithm Complexity as well today, but, I couldn't sit past 1 hour mark, as I couldn't focus. How do I fix this ? üò£

## day 8 : 16 August 2023

**Progress :** Solved Coding Problems on Arrays.

**Final Thoughts :** I didn't solve too many problems, but, it felt good to be back. I am going totry my best to be consistent from now on. I solved 5 problems I think. The "Triplet Sum" and "Sort 0 1 2" i'll solve tomorrow. I got stuck in almost every problem today, but, still I think it's going to get better. ü•≤

## day 9 : 22 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a revision of everything I studied up until now and solved a bunch of Basic Coding Problems.

**Final Thoughts :** I solved some coding problems today, and also did a revision. Need to be consistent. üò£üò£üò£

## Update (09 September 2023)

I have slacked off for 15+ days now. This is what always ends up happening. It starts as skipping 1-2 days, and then becomes a very long time. And then, when I come back, I feel like "I can't remember anything" and "I should start from beginning, again", and the cycle repeats. What do I have to do to get out of this cycle ? üò£

But, anyway I am thinking of continuing after day 9. Maybe, I should just scrap this and start from beginning, but, I want to keep this to remind me how bad simply skipping 1-2 days can become, so I don't do it again. Of course, I know when I open Arrays, where I left, I'm going to feel like a complete Idiot who doesn't remeber anything and I'm going to want to study up until then again. So, I think I'm going to do revision for 2-3 days first, then I'll do day 10.

So, I think I am doing revision of **C++ Basics** for now. After that, I'll continue with #100DaysOfCode.

This starting to become like a journal now. Maybe I'll start writting more in this md-file from now on. Maybe that'll keep me from slacking.

But, for now, that is all.

## Revision (12 September 2023)

I have been studying basics again and I studied how really C++ works behind the scenes in depth. I got to know a lot about C++ Preprocessing, Compilation process, and Lineing etc. It's actually really interesting. I have also been solving problems. Nothing too difficult, just the ones from "Basics of C++" COding-Ninjas course. I think I'll rervise stuff till day after tomorrow and then I'll cotinue.

Well, that's it for today. I'll update later.

## Revision (18 September 2023)

I have been revising and procrastinating and so revision is over. Tomorrow I'll starrt with day10. I'll do arrays and maybe solve a few Questions. I really want to keep up this time.

## day 10 : 19 September 2023

**Progress :** Started with Arrays (again) and solved some coding problems from it too.

**Final Thoughts :** I think it's been a long time since I enjoyed getting my ass kicked by C++ so mouch üòÇ. Today I started Arrays from the beginning again. And, as I have already done it multiple times in the past, theoretically it's not something I struggle with really, but, I always feel like I am still not there, when I'm solving problems. I can't say that I have finally achieved satisfaction with my problem solving skills in Arrays (well, I got stuck in that 1 problem `3Sum` from Coding Ninjas), but, I think I definitely made some progress. I think with just a little bit more effort I'll finally start feeling satisfied with myself. But, for now, I only want to say one thing - The struggle is not over. yet.

## day 11 : 20 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued with solving coding problems in Arrays. Actually I only solved 2 problems. They took a few hours actually.

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm. `Sort 0 1 2` is easy but, how do I say this... there was one really interesting method to solve it, and one very dumb method to solve it. I spent like half an hour on the interesting method, and got TLE, and the dumb one worked just fine üò¢. So, basically, I GOT SCAMMED. Apart from that, I solved `3Sum` from Coding Ninjas as well. I managed to solve it although all testcases didn't pass. It ended up taking 2-3+ hours, and there were a few issues in my logic. I finally managed to finish it, but got TLE in some testcases. I think I'm gonna leave that problem at that. When I learn a few new things I will come back to it I guess. So, yeah that's it for today. I just saw the time, and it's already past 12, and I hadn't updated the repo with day11's progress, so I am doing it now. But, I actually plan to solve two problems from LeetCode too, before I go to sleep. I hope it doesn't take too long.

## day 12 : 21 September 2023

**Progress :** I did Algorithm Complexity yesterday (i studied but i was busy so couldn't update repo). I watched Video Lecture on it. I was very busy so couldn't solve any problems on Time and Space Complexity.

**Final Thoughts :** Well, not enough progress really. I was busy with a bunch of things. 

## day 13 : 22 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued with Algorithm Complexity. Solved problems as well (around 25-30). But, that's it. Again I didn't solve a lot of problems. But, tomorrow I'm gonna start Binary Search. And, I'll spend a lot of time studying and solving problems. I promise. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** Okay, so I think i did give 1.5 hours today, but, I don't think I made too much progress. I just finished Algorithm Complexity. Apart from that I started solving "Problem of the Day" from Coding Ninjas. Well I could only solve the MCQ's today (not even the EASY coding problem üò£üò£üò£). But, tomorrow I'll do better. I'm atleast happy that now I have started solving those random problems that Coding Ninjas gives. Earlier I used to think I'm not skilled enough to be able to solve any of them, so I didn't try solving them. I hope in a few weeks I become smart enough to solve Medium level questions as well. That's it for today.

## day 14 : 23 September 2023

**Progress :** Started Binary Search. Just that. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** I started Bianry Search. There was a youtube video I was watching, and, BAM. My interent was just gone. And, well, my mom forgot to pay intrnet bill, and next day was sunday,  so nothing could've been done about it. Also, mobile data sucks exactly when I need it to work the most. So, yeah I think I studies for some 30-35 mins. And, then I couldn't continue on. üò¢

## day 15 : 24 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued on and finished Binary Search. And, that's it.

**Final Progress :** So, I still didn't have internet. My mobile data decided to work properly today so I was able to continue, but well, all I did was finish Binary Search (theory part) today. Will solve problems tomorrow. üò¢

## day 16 : 25 September 2023

**Progress :** Solved 3 Binary Search problems.

**Final Thoughts :** Internet finally started working today. But, it started working late at night, around 8pm, and I had to work without it before it. After it started working again I went ahead and did a lot of studying. Well, I did put in 3-4 hours today, but, I did all that just to manage to solve 3 LeetCode problems, they were Medium level though. But, i don't know how to feel about this. I am putting the time, but, when I compare the progress with the amount of time, I feel dumb for using up so much time for doing "little ?" üò£üò£üò£

## day 17 : 26 September 2023

**Progress :** Solved more Binary Search Problems.

**Final Thoughts :** Today I solved more Binary Search Problems. It's not as simple of an approach as it looks in first glance. There actually are a lot of different ways to implement it. I mainly just solved a few problems today (some 2-3...) . But, I got to learn a lot today. Looking forward to tomorrow.

## day 18 : 27 September 2023

**Progress :** Solved 3-4 Advanced Binary Search Problems like Book Allocation Problem, etc.

**Final Thoughts :** After a long time I'm feeling completely exhausted. I think I spent 5-7 hours understanding and solving Binary Search Problems (Book Allocation Problem, Aggressive Cows, etc.) and honestly, what are these problems...
I had to spend a lot of time understanding and experimenting with them to properly understand them. And, honestly it's pretty insane, the logic used to solve these problems. I think after spending so much time understanding the approach I am capable to solve these types of problems. but, as I'm completely done for the day, I'm gonna solve some of these problems tomorrow, and then I'm gonna start **Sorting Algorithms**. Let's see how I can do tomorrow. ü´°

## day 19 : 28 September 2023

**Progress :** Completed all the basic Sorting Algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort). I did it all in 1 day (very proud, hehe üòÑ).

**Final Thoughts :** So, I'm feeling very happy today as I managed to complete all the sorting algorithms. I think I still don't get Insertion sort fully (i'm probably 80/100 in it) but, that's fine I think. Tomorrow I'm planning to maybe revise Insertion sort again, and start with **C++ STL**. So yeah, will come back tomorrow. üòÅ

## day 20 : 29 September 2023

**Progrerss :** Completed C++ STL. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** This was very boring. I felt like I'm studying Python actually. Not that I hate python, but, it has so many inbuilt functions, that I used to get irrtated that "I have to remember so much stuff". And, that is exactly what I felt in STL. Well, somehow I finished it. Tomorrow I'll be solving Problems from LeetCode and Coding Ninjas. That's it for today. Gud Nite!

## day 21 : 30 September 2023

**Progress :** Today I solved 1 coding problem on Arrays from Coding Ninjas. That's it.

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm, IDK why but, for some reason I didn't feel like coding today really. I had planned to do atleast 3 problems today following the course video, but, I started feeling really sleepy while studying. I tried to keep going but, ultimately stopped. I think today I did coding for some 40 minutes only. So, yeah not very good. But, tomorrow I'll finish it. THat's it for today.

## day 22 : 1 October 2023

**Progress :** Finished yesterday's stuff that I had left, and solved 3 more problems.

**Final Thoughts :** So, firstly I finished the problems that I had to yesterday, and then I did 3 more problems. In total, I did 5 problems today. Although, I think i was constantly ignored doing "dry-run" to solve the problems. And, I kind of feel bad about it too, but, maybe it's fine, because I did spend some 15-20 minutes on each problems, but, I wasn't trying to scribble on paper to solve it, but, instead I was staring on the screen. Now, I think a part of the reason I'm feeling bad about it is because whenever I get stuch at a problem I tend to spend hours trying to solve it, which in a lot of cases might be unnecessary and I want to change that so, yeah. Although I think I should use pen-n-paper more, in those 15-20 mins, instead of staring at screen and thinking that somehow if I stare at it hard enough I'll magically find the answer. So, yeah I think that's it. I should keep that in mind from now on. Gud Nite now. üòÖ

## day 23 : 2 October 2023

**Progress :** Today, I didn't study actually new. I did revision, and tried to solve all the coding problems again.

**Final Thoughts :** Revision is important too. Instead of just going forward everyday, I should keep revising old topics time to time as well. So, I decide to revise by solving all the coding problems. And, I think I solved some 20+ problems again. But, there are still a few remainng. Also, I think I needed to revisit "Binary Search" again, and today I couldn't do that, so, I'm gonna do that tomorrow. Also, there is one coding contest exam paper that I wanted to solve, so that also, I'll do tomorrow. Slow and Steady wins the Race!!! üòÅ

## day 24 : 4 October 2023

**Progress :** Today I continued revision. I could only do 1 qquestion i think, and then I got stuck in the next question, and then again on the next question, and then I got so irritated that I stopped. I still havn't managed to complete everything. But, I'm gonna leave revision at that for now.

**Final Thoughts :** So, first of all, yesterday I didn't study. So, that breaks the streak. But, I don't want to mind that too much. Secondly, revisions becomes so boring after some time (seriously). I am still stuck on the Binary Search Revision, but, I'm thinking of leaving revision for now, and continuing on with *Character Arrays and Strings*, the next topic. I think I should revise Binary Search again, in a proper way. So, just-solve-problems-and-go approach is not gonna work just yet with it, and trying that felt like I'm just pointlessly dragging it, and wasting the time I couldv'e spent studying. So, next time, when I do Revision, it's going to be Binary Search, and I'm going to do it properly. Tomorrow I'll start Arrays. So yeah that's it. üòì
