# Logs of Round 1

> #100DaysOfCode

## day 1 : 21 july 2023

**Progress :** Started revision of C++ basics from the beginning. Wrote a few basic programs as well. And, revised a few important theory topics.

Important Topics :

- `char` datatype (ASCII and extended ASCII representation of `char` and `unsigned char`)
- *Storing* and *Reading* positive and negative numbers in memory
- `bool` type (reprentation, and **Negation** behavior).

**Final Thought:** I've done C++ before, so this is basically revision. Mostly i only did boring stuff today, but, I'm happy for completing day1. üòå

## day 2 : 22 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Operators (including Bitwise that took some time), then moved onto conditional statements, and loops, and finally solved some 10-15 problems (easy ones) on them.

Important Topics :

- Important Bitwise Operations and their rules and tricks.

**Final Thought:** Hmmm, honestly I feel bad for today's progress. I think I covered quite less than what I intended. I also couldn't really focus very well. I have an important report that I have to work on and I spent most of the time getting scared abut how I'm going to finish it on time. üò¢

## day 3 : 23 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Bitwise Shift Operators (i forgot to study it yesterday), Functions, Memory layout of C, switch statement, and solved a few basic problems of Functions. Solved an easy problem from LeetCode as well.

Important Topics :

- Result of applying `>>` (right shift operator) on **negative** numbers, (*it makes them positive numebrs*).
- Memory layout in C / C++.

**Final Thought:** So, today i think I somewhat managed to finished the intended topics, although I counldn't solve coding problems from platforms like LeedCode, etc. I wanted to solve quite a few problems, but, as I sat down for this very late, I'm probably gonna solve problems tomorrow the whole time. I'm still feeling good though, as now I have finally completed Basics of C++, and I can start Data Structures from 25th. üôÉ

## day 4 : 24 july 2023

**Progress :** Solved problems from Leetcode, GFG, and CodeStudio. That's It.

**Final Thoughts :** It feels irritating when when u can't solve a problem bucause u made a mistake so small that u had to stare at the screen for 20+ mins to find it. LeetCode #7 and #1009 kind of irritated me. But, I finally managed to solve them, and all other ones too. So, I guess it wasn't that bad afterall. Tomorrow I will finally be starting DSA. And, DSA is the part that I have left in the middle a few too many times in the past. Hopefully I don't do it again this time. üêº

> I didn't do anything for last few days... üò¢
<br> I was working on that godamn project report. üò≠üò≠üò≠
<br> Finally it's over, so now i'll focus on it from tomorrow again. ü´§

## day 5 : 31 july 2023

**Progress :** Started Arrays (the first data structure). Solved a few problems, and did Linear Search too. Couldn't do Binary Search today. Will do that tomorrow.

**Final Thoughts :** I'm back. Finally... <br> I ended up taking a long break, almost a week, and now, I'm starting it again. Today i did Arrays. It's still a revision so I don't find it tough really. I did till Linear search today, didn't have enought time to cover Binary Search too. Will complete that tomorrow. Honestly, I feel like shit for taking such a long break. üò£

## day 6 : 2 august 2023

**Progress :** Continued on with Arrays, and did Binary Search. Also, solved a few problems. I found out that we can use XOR operations to swap 2 numbers. I didn't know that.

Important Topics :

- Different ways to `swap()` two numbers.
- Binary Search Optimization for dealing with *overflow case*.

**Final Thoughts :** I skipped again yesterday. And, I'll have to skip the next few days as well as I'm going out of station, and I won't have my laptop. So, I'll probably be back once I return in a few days. As, for today I ended Binary Search. I wanted to do Complexity Analysis as well, but, I thought it would be better to do it after I return. I don't want to go on a break just after studying that. üêº

## day 7 : 9 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a basic revision of Arrays, and Searching Algorithms. And started vectors. Couldn't finish vectors today.

Important Topics :

- `memset()` function
- Designated Initialization

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm, I have returned back home, and resumed DSA today. I started Vectors today, and well, I'm struggling. Not because it's tough, but, idk. I'm finding sitting and coding for more than an hour tough. I feel like stopping and watching youtube or something when I code. I initially wanted to complete Algorithm Complexity as well today, but, I couldn't sit past 1 hour mark, as I couldn't focus. How do I fix this ? üò£

## day 8 : 16 August 2023

**Progress :** Solved Coding Problems on Arrays.

**Final Thoughts :** I didn't solve too many problems, but, it felt good to be back. I am going totry my best to be consistent from now on. I solved 5 problems I think. The "Triplet Sum" and "Sort 0 1 2" i'll solve tomorrow. I got stuck in almost every problem today, but, still I think it's going to get better. ü•≤

## day 9 : 22 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a revision of everything I studied up until now and solved a bunch of Basic Coding Problems.

**Final Thoughts :** I solved some coding problems today, and also did a revision. Need to be consistent. üò£üò£üò£

## Update (09 September 2023)

I have slacked off for 15+ days now. This is what always ends up happening. It starts as skipping 1-2 days, and then becomes a very long time. And then, when I come back, I feel like "I can't remember anything" and "I should start from beginning, again", and the cycle repeats. What do I have to do to get out of this cycle ? üò£

But, anyway I am thinking of continuing after day 9. Maybe, I should just scrap this and start from beginning, but, I want to keep this to remind me how bad simply skipping 1-2 days can become, so I don't do it again. Of course, I know when I open Arrays, where I left, I'm going to feel like a complete Idiot who doesn't remeber anything and I'm going to want to study up until then again. So, I think I'm going to do revision for 2-3 days first, then I'll do day 10.

So, I think I am doing revision of **C++ Basics** for now. After that, I'll continue with #100DaysOfCode.

This starting to become like a journal now. Maybe I'll start writting more in this md-file from now on. Maybe that'll keep me from slacking.

But, for now, that is all.

## Revision (12 September 2023)

I have been studying basics again and I studied how really C++ works behind the scenes in depth. I got to know a lot about C++ Preprocessing, Compilation process, and Lineing etc. It's actually really interesting. I have also been solving problems. Nothing too difficult, just the ones from "Basics of C++" COding-Ninjas course. I think I'll rervise stuff till day after tomorrow and then I'll cotinue.

Well, that's it for today. I'll update later.

## Revision (18 September 2023)

I have been revising and procrastinating and so revision is over. Tomorrow I'll starrt with day10. I'll do arrays and maybe solve a few Questions. I really want to keep up this time.

## day 10 : 19 September 2023

**Progress :** Started with Arrays (again) and solved some coding problems from it too.

**Final Thoughts :** I think it's been a long time since I enjoyed getting my ass kicked by C++ so mouch üòÇ. Today I started Arrays from the beginning again. And, as I have already done it multiple times in the past, theoretically it's not something I struggle with really, but, I always feel like I am still not there, when I'm solving problems. I can't say that I have finally achieved satisfaction with my problem solving skills in Arrays (well, I got stuck in that 1 problem `3Sum` from Coding Ninjas), but, I think I definitely made some progress. I think with just a little bit more effort I'll finally start feeling satisfied with myself. But, for now, I only want to say one thing - The struggle is not over. yet.

## day 11 : 20 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued with solving coding problems in Arrays. Actually I only solved 2 problems. They took a few hours actually.

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm. `Sort 0 1 2` is easy but, how do I say this... there was one really interesting method to solve it, and one very dumb method to solve it. I spent like half an hour on the interesting method, and got TLE, and the dumb one worked just fine üò¢. So, basically, I GOT SCAMMED. Apart from that, I solved `3Sum` from Coding Ninjas as well. I managed to solve it although all testcases didn't pass. It ended up taking 2-3+ hours, and there were a few issues in my logic. I finally managed to finish it, but got TLE in some testcases. I think I'm gonna leave that problem at that. When I learn a few new things I will come back to it I guess. So, yeah that's it for today. I just saw the time, and it's already past 12, and I hadn't updated the repo with day11's progress, so I am doing it now. But, I actually plan to solve two problems from LeetCode too, before I go to sleep. I hope it doesn't take too long.

## day 12 : 21 September 2023

**Progress :** I did Algorithm Complexity yesterday (i studied but i was busy so couldn't update repo). I watched Video Lecture on it. I was very busy so couldn't solve any problems on Time and Space Complexity.

**Final Thoughts :** Well, not enough progress really. I was busy with a bunch of things.

## day 13 : 22 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued with Algorithm Complexity. Solved problems as well (around 25-30). But, that's it. Again I didn't solve a lot of problems. But, tomorrow I'm gonna start Binary Search. And, I'll spend a lot of time studying and solving problems. I promise. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** Okay, so I think i did give 1.5 hours today, but, I don't think I made too much progress. I just finished Algorithm Complexity. Apart from that I started solving "Problem of the Day" from Coding Ninjas. Well I could only solve the MCQ's today (not even the EASY coding problem üò£üò£üò£). But, tomorrow I'll do better. I'm atleast happy that now I have started solving those random problems that Coding Ninjas gives. Earlier I used to think I'm not skilled enough to be able to solve any of them, so I didn't try solving them. I hope in a few weeks I become smart enough to solve Medium level questions as well. That's it for today.

## day 14 : 23 September 2023

**Progress :** Started Binary Search. Just that. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** I started Bianry Search. There was a youtube video I was watching, and, BAM. My interent was just gone. And, well, my mom forgot to pay intrnet bill, and next day was sunday,  so nothing could've been done about it. Also, mobile data sucks exactly when I need it to work the most. So, yeah I think I studies for some 30-35 mins. And, then I couldn't continue on. üò¢

## day 15 : 24 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued on and finished Binary Search. And, that's it.

**Final Progress :** So, I still didn't have internet. My mobile data decided to work properly today so I was able to continue, but well, all I did was finish Binary Search (theory part) today. Will solve problems tomorrow. üò¢

## day 16 : 25 September 2023

**Progress :** Solved 3 Binary Search problems.

**Final Thoughts :** Internet finally started working today. But, it started working late at night, around 8pm, and I had to work without it before it. After it started working again I went ahead and did a lot of studying. Well, I did put in 3-4 hours today, but, I did all that just to manage to solve 3 LeetCode problems, they were Medium level though. But, i don't know how to feel about this. I am putting the time, but, when I compare the progress with the amount of time, I feel dumb for using up so much time for doing "little ?" üò£üò£üò£

## day 17 : 26 September 2023

**Progress :** Solved more Binary Search Problems.

**Final Thoughts :** Today I solved more Binary Search Problems. It's not as simple of an approach as it looks in first glance. There actually are a lot of different ways to implement it. I mainly just solved a few problems today (some 2-3...) . But, I got to learn a lot today. Looking forward to tomorrow.

## day 18 : 27 September 2023

**Progress :** Solved 3-4 Advanced Binary Search Problems like Book Allocation Problem, etc.

**Final Thoughts :** After a long time I'm feeling completely exhausted. I think I spent 5-7 hours understanding and solving Binary Search Problems (Book Allocation Problem, Aggressive Cows, etc.) and honestly, what are these problems...
I had to spend a lot of time understanding and experimenting with them to properly understand them. And, honestly it's pretty insane, the logic used to solve these problems. I think after spending so much time understanding the approach I am capable to solve these types of problems. but, as I'm completely done for the day, I'm gonna solve some of these problems tomorrow, and then I'm gonna start **Sorting Algorithms**. Let's see how I can do tomorrow. ü´°

## day 19 : 28 September 2023

**Progress :** Completed all the basic Sorting Algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, and Insertion Sort). I did it all in 1 day (very proud, hehe üòÑ).

**Final Thoughts :** So, I'm feeling very happy today as I managed to complete all the sorting algorithms. I think I still don't get Insertion sort fully (i'm probably 80/100 in it) but, that's fine I think. Tomorrow I'm planning to maybe revise Insertion sort again, and start with **C++ STL**. So yeah, will come back tomorrow. üòÅ

## day 20 : 29 September 2023

**Progrerss :** Completed C++ STL. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** This was very boring. I felt like I'm studying Python actually. Not that I hate python, but, it has so many inbuilt functions, that I used to get irrtated that "I have to remember so much stuff". And, that is exactly what I felt in STL. Well, somehow I finished it. Tomorrow I'll be solving Problems from LeetCode and Coding Ninjas. That's it for today. Gud Nite!

## day 21 : 30 September 2023

**Progress :** Today I solved 1 coding problem on Arrays from Coding Ninjas. That's it.

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm, IDK why but, for some reason I didn't feel like coding today really. I had planned to do atleast 3 problems today following the course video, but, I started feeling really sleepy while studying. I tried to keep going but, ultimately stopped. I think today I did coding for some 40 minutes only. So, yeah not very good. But, tomorrow I'll finish it. THat's it for today.

## day 22 : 1 October 2023

**Progress :** Finished yesterday's stuff that I had left, and solved 3 more problems.

**Final Thoughts :** So, firstly I finished the problems that I had to yesterday, and then I did 3 more problems. In total, I did 5 problems today. Although, I think i was constantly ignored doing "dry-run" to solve the problems. And, I kind of feel bad about it too, but, maybe it's fine, because I did spend some 15-20 minutes on each problems, but, I wasn't trying to scribble on paper to solve it, but, instead I was staring on the screen. Now, I think a part of the reason I'm feeling bad about it is because whenever I get stuch at a problem I tend to spend hours trying to solve it, which in a lot of cases might be unnecessary and I want to change that so, yeah. Although I think I should use pen-n-paper more, in those 15-20 mins, instead of staring at screen and thinking that somehow if I stare at it hard enough I'll magically find the answer. So, yeah I think that's it. I should keep that in mind from now on. Gud Nite now. üòÖ

## day 23 : 2 October 2023

**Progress :** Today, I didn't study actually new. I did revision, and tried to solve all the coding problems again.

**Final Thoughts :** Revision is important too. Instead of just going forward everyday, I should keep revising old topics time to time as well. So, I decide to revise by solving all the coding problems. And, I think I solved some 20+ problems again. But, there are still a few remainng. Also, I think I needed to revisit "Binary Search" again, and today I couldn't do that, so, I'm gonna do that tomorrow. Also, there is one coding contest exam paper that I wanted to solve, so that also, I'll do tomorrow. Slow and Steady wins the Race!!! üòÅ

## day 24 : 4 October 2023

**Progress :** Today I continued revision. I could only do 1 qquestion i think, and then I got stuck in the next question, and then again on the next question, and then I got so irritated that I stopped. I still havn't managed to complete everything. But, I'm gonna leave revision at that for now.

**Final Thoughts :** So, first of all, yesterday I didn't study. So, that breaks the streak. But, I don't want to mind that too much. Secondly, revisions becomes so boring after some time (seriously). I am still stuck on the Binary Search Revision, but, I'm thinking of leaving revision for now, and continuing on with *Character Arrays and Strings*, the next topic. I think I should revise Binary Search again, in a proper way. So, just-solve-problems-and-go approach is not gonna work just yet with it, and trying that felt like I'm just pointlessly dragging it, and wasting the time I couldv'e spent studying. So, next time, when I do Revision, it's going to be Binary Search, and I'm going to do it properly. Tomorrow I'll start Arrays. So yeah that's it. üòì

## day 25 : 5 October 2023

**Progress :** So, mainly I started Character Arrays and Strings, but, couldn't study for too long. Probably 30-40 mins only. I think I solved 2-3 easy problems.

**Final Tohoghts :** I'm going out of station for a few days. I have to go back to college for my convocation. So, I probably won't be getting enough time for studying. Today, I started Character Arrays and Strings, although I couldn't spend much time, I don't think it's very difficult. I was actually finding stuffs easy. Hopefully I manage to finish it soon, after I continu with day 26. ü´§

## Update (09 October 2023)

I have returned home today morning and I'll be continuing my 100days from today. I plan to finish as much of Stirngs part as possible as it is quite a lengthy lecture. But, hopefully by tomorrow I'll definitely be able to finish it. Also, the last "**Update**" was on 9th of Sept., ie. exactly a month back (what a coincidence!). So, yeah I as feeling kind of scared going for convocation, as I don't have a job and I would've met everyone who is already working somewhere, but, it turned out to be actually fun. üòÖ

But, yeah still a lot of work is left, and I'm gonna start from today itself. Let's GOOO!!! üòÅ

## day 26 : 09 October 2023

**Progress :** Continued with Character Arrays and Strings. Tomorrow I'll be bale to finish it definitely.

**Final Thoughts :** It feels nice to be back. I think I couldv'e put more time, but, I should start preparing for sleep. I want to get up early from tomorrow. I finished half of the lecture and also solved around 5-7 problems today. I will definitely finish it tomorrow. Looking forward to it. üòÅ

## day 27 : 10 October 2023

**Progress :** Continued on with Strings. It's still not over. üò£

**Final Thoughts :** It starting to bore me. I don't want to start skipping again. Today I wanted to finish the lecture, but, I feel like I'm dragging it. Will finish Strings tomorrow. I think only some 20-25 mins of the lecture is remaining, but, Strings might become a topic I should revise again. I don't feel confident enough. I think I should try to create the inbuilt string functions on my own. But, let's finish this first tomorrow. Then, I'll decide what I want to do about it. ü´§ü´§ü´§

## day 28 : 13 October 2023

**Progress :** Started Strings from beginning again, and finished half of it.

**Final Thoughts :** So, I skipped for 2 days. Well, I think I didn't want to complete Strings. I had almost completed it, but, I wasn't felinig very good about it, I was feeling very inconfident. So, I just didn't study. I mean, I was procrastinating, but, mainly I didn't want to finish this in a half-assed way, and go forward, so, I was deciding weather I start from beginning or carry on. And, well, as I didn't want to just carry on, I ultimately decided to do Strings again, took 2 days in deciding that. I have started feeling confident now. I have done half of the lecture today, and am confident that I'll finish the other half tomorrow. So, yeah that's it. Finally Strings will be over. üòä

## day 29 : 14 October 2023

**Progress :** There are 4 more problems left in Strings. It's not over yet, but, tomorrow definitely it'll be over.

**Final Thoughts :** So, strings is still not over. I did say I'll finish it today, but, I decided to do in-built stirng functions properly, in a very in-depth way, and so I have properly been studying and making notes baout them. There are still around 10 functions remaining. And, after that I'll just finish the 4 remaining problems and strings will finally be over. So, I think tomorrow is the day, and even though I couldn't finish the goal I set yesterday, I'm very happy with today's progress. üòÅ

## day 30 : 17 October 2023

**Progress :** Finally finished Strings. üò£

**Final Thoughts :** First of all, I did study the last two days as well, I just didn't update the repo. Second, Stirngs are finally over, and I.m so done with them. I think strings is a really irritating topic, even though it doesn't seem irritation at first. I'm just glad it's over. Although, I'm scared that 2-D arrays, which is the next topic is going to be even more irritating. But, let's see. L did study last two days too. But, I was so irritated while studying that I kinda don;t want to count them. I did  put 2-3 hors everyday for last 3 days but, I couldn't cover enough material, so yeah, I'm just going to make today day30. Now I'll go. üòì

## day 31 : 18 October 2023

**Progress :** I started 2-D arrays today. Completed most of it.

**FInal Thoughts :** I started 2-D arrays, and completed most of it. All that is left is Binary Search in 2-D array. I'll finish that tomorrow. There are also a few problems that I have to solve (Spiral Print, and Rotate Matrix). So, yeah that's it. üôÉ

## day 32 : 19 October 2023

**Progress :** Completed Strings finally.

**Final Thoughts :** So, I have finally finished Strings, and now I'm done with Arrays. FINALLY!!! Soooo, happy. Next I'm gonna do Maths for DSA and then Phase - 1 over for the course. üòÅ

## day 33 : 21 October 2023

**Progress :** I did half of Maths for DSA lecture. Well, it was boring so, I ....    slept in the middle of it. üòì

**Final Thoughts :** Good Morning. I'll finish it tomorrow. ü•¥

## day 34 : 23 October 2023

**Progress :** Today I finished Maths for DSA Lecture.

**Final Thoughts :** So, first of all, yesterday I didn't study I had to do my packing as I was going for a few days. I was coming from one home toanother, so, I can continue studying. No, trouble with that this time. And, for day before yesterday, well, I fell asleep. I didn't sleep properly day before, and so, I ended up sleeping while studying. My bad. But, I decided to start Maths for DSA from the beginning today. And, I could've finished it so early, if not for that dumb glitch. C++ error messages are really the worst. I managed to fix the code ultimately, but, I still don't understand what that bug was even. So, I did finish the lecture, but, I have quite a bit of homework. I'm gonna take a break now as phase-I si finally over. And, after that I'll start with Pointers. I know I have been irregular lately, and, well, It doesn't have a bad reason, I am not feeling really unsatisfied with progress. But, yeah I should be more regular, and that is exactly what I'm gonna do. But, I think right now I should enjoy the milestone so, I'll be abck in a few days. How many days ? I'll  decide it later. üòÑüòÇ.

***See Yaaa!     soon.***

## day 35 : 07 November 2023

**Progress :** Started Pinters. Watched first video.

**Final Thoughts :** I am back. I took too long. I know, I'm sorry. I planned to take off 4-5 days. Then I kept procrastinating. But, I've finally returned. I'll try to be regular again. Also, I'm thinking, From now, I am gonna try to revise old topics more. Like, i think "Binary Search" still is incomplete. So, I'm gonna try and find time to do that as well. But, today I started Pointers. I completed first lecture. Tomorrow I'll do second. I don't know if I should make some kind of notes for it, I'm already good at pointers, so. I think I'll write something. See you tomorrow. ü´§

## day 36 : 08 November 2023

**Progress :** Today, well I thought I'll do second part of Pointers, but, I redid part-1. And, made notes about it.

**Final Thoughts :** So, now I'll do the part-2 tomorrow. That's all. I can't think of writting anything else. So, See you tomorrow.

## Update (19 Novemeber 2023)

So, I havn't been updating the repository for some 10 days. And, It isn't that I havn't been studying, but, rather I keep sleeping on updating the repo. So, I am going to update the repo starting now. I think instead of updating the repo for last 10 days, all at once, I'm going to do it day-by-day. I only want to make 2-3 commits everyday. That's why.

## day 37 : 09 November 2023

**Progress :** Started the 2nd video in Pointers. Couldn't complete it.

**Final Thoughts :** So, I started the Pointers second video, did Array with Pointers.

## day 38 : 10 November 2023

**Progress :** Finished 2nd lecture of Pointers.

**Final Thoughts :** Finished 2nd lecture in Pointers. Completed Charachter Arrays, and Function with Pointers.

## day 39 : 11 November 2023

**Progress :** Completed Pointer-to-Pointer (Double Pointer), and solved a lot of MCQ-type problems.

**Final THoughts :** I did 3rd lecture, and all of Pointers with it. Next is Dynamic Memort Allocation.

## day 40 : 12 November 2023

**Progress :** Completed Reference Variables, and Dynamic Memory Allocation.

**Final Thoughts :** I finished Reference Variable and Dynamic Memory Allocation. Next is Macros, Inline Functions, etc. The following lecture is about a few small easy topics. Looking forward to it.

## day 41 : 13 November 2023

**Progress :** Did Dynamic Memory Allocation again, and, also revised Pointers, and solved problems from it.

**Final Thoughts :** I redid Dynamic Memory Allocation, and revised Pointers again. I think I am going to revise it again.

## day 42 : 14 November 2023

**Progress :** Did lecture on Macros, Global variables, Default Arguments, etc.

**Final Thoughts :** I finished the lecture that contains small topics like Global Variables, Macros, Default Arguments, etc. I will be doing a revision of Pointer and then move to Recursions.

## day 43 : 17 November 2023

**Progress :** Did a revision of Pointers and related topics. That's it.

**FInal Thoguhts :** I did not study for a couple of days, as I wasn't well. But, Today I started revision of Pointers. I will continue doing Pointers Revision for 1-2 more days, before I start Recursion.

## Update (27 November 2023)

So, I have been studying for the last few days, but, I have struggle with being regular once again. I started Recursions, even. I hadn't been updating the repository, and that partly was as well contributing to me slaking off, I think. I decided that I will revise Arrays, and solve it's problems as well, and I'll do it while studying new topics. ut, I havn't been able to manage 2-3 things instead of just 1 proprly.

Right now, I want to continue studying DSA, and revise old topics (ones I'm not too confident in), and also solve COding Problems. But, I have been strugging with that. And, I also started doing Kotlin language as well. It's not something I have to put too much time in, but, I feel drained after doing only a little bit of studying, and then I don't do all the things I planned to do. And, has been the biggest problem with my studying, I think. I have to find out how I'm supposed to fix that.

I am thinking I'll list out what are the things I first of all want to do :

- Revise sorting algorithms, before I start with recutrsions, as I know there are going be a few new sorting algorithms I'll learn in Recursions. **I want to do this before I start Recursions**
- Revise entirety of Array, I think the toughest part in it is still going to be Binary Search. üò£
- If possible look into this Energy Drain thing. How do I prevent it from happening so fast...

So, that's the things I can think of right now. Maybe, I remember someting later. I'll update the repo then. That's it for now. I'm going to start doing a revision, firstly of Sorting Algorithms, from today. And, even though I did start rcursions, I'll start from recursions once again. This'll also end the backlog on my repo.

That's it for now.

> I have finished doing Sorting algorithm. All 3 of them. Binary Search is still left. I feel like I may just leave it. and focus on problem solving.

## Update 29 November 2023

So, I'm going to start Recursions today. I think I'll do the first video atleast. But, I want to see if I can do 2 videos. Yesterday, at night, I did a very quick full revision of Arrays. I'm starting to revise Sorting Algorithms, and then I'll probably do Binary Search (just the basics, I'm thinking). After that I'll start wwith Recursions. I have also been studying Kotlin programming language, on the side. For like a week. I am thinking weather I should update the repo with Kotlin stuff as well or not. I'm not very sure about it for now, but, I'll decide.

It's night, and, well I did do revision of Sorting Aglorithms, but, nothing else. So, I'll actually start Recursions tomorrow now. Or, if I can't sleep I may change my mind. But, until then, that's it for now.

## Today is 26 December

I havn't started Recursions yet. I took a really very big gap. I shouldn't have let this happen. Let's start from today. Properly. I am going to be seriously continue, and finish the 100 Days. Starting now.

## day 44 : 26 December 2023

Technically, it's 27th December now, as it's 2'o' clock at night, but, I did Recursion Day-1 and 2 videos today. Solved the few simple basic Recursion Problems, like Counting to `n`, Findinf Power of 2, and Factorial, etc. Tomorrow (i mean today) I'll start and finish Recursion day-3.

## day 45 : 27 December 2023

Today I did Recursion day-3. (Once again, it's actually 28th December now as it's past 12'o clock) I felt like I'm not actually in the Zone while studying. I felt like I should start fresh again, but, I think I'm going to just stop paying attention to these indications, adn I'm going to just go ahead and see what happens. I thinks I may have been paying too mush unnecessay attention to the pointless things. And, it has also affected my efficiency to a great extent too. But, well, there is a lot of Home-Work first of all. It's is going to take some serious amount of time. I have to solve all Array Problems using Recursions, specially Binary Search Problems. The problems, I didn't solve all binary Search problems in the first place. So, let's see if tomorrow I'll be able to start with day-4 or not. Weather I can do day-4 tomorrow or not, I'll definitely spend a lot of time solving Array Problems, using Recursions. So, that's it for today.

Now, apart from DSA, I also studied Git today. I have been studying it as well since yesterday. And, honestly, I have always found it difficult. I have seen a lot of toutorials, and stuff, and they have been good toutorials too I think, but, none of them have managed to make me feel that Git is a piece of cake, ut, I've been learning Git using the fireship course I must say, it's definitely a piece-of-cake. I'm really enjoying doing it. Also, I think I'm going to be able to finish it in a couple of days.

Also, I think I'm going to try to write to repo before 12 tomorrow. For now, that's it. Good Night.

## day 46 : 03 January 2024

Happy New Year!!!

So, I have been studying Git for last few days, but, DSA not so much. I did solve all Array Problems using Recursions, today. But, Binary Search Problems are still remaining (13 of them). I am going to do those problems tomorrow. And, probably day after tomorrow, I'll start with next video.

## Update (09.01.2024)

So, I have been trying to revise and finally be done with Binary Search and Recursion (BS part) for last few days. I havn't been studying everyday, but, when I did, I thought that maybe this time, I'll really be done with Binary Search for good. But, I was Wrong. I still have trouble with it and as a result I get stuck. And, then, I stay stucked there, and days pass üòì. So, I think it's better to move forward. I managed to solve a few Binary Search Problems using Recursions properly, and have understood how Recursion works in Binary Search. So, today I'm going to start with the next toutorial, in day `47`.

And, THIS TIME I'm REALLY GOING TO BE **REGULAR**.

## day 47 : 09 January 2024

Just finished Recursion-day04, and now I'm updating the repo. There are homework problems that I'll do now. Today, I basically solved 4 question, 2 from Strings, 1 of Exponentiation (using recursion), which was really very interesting. And, last was bubble sort using recursion. I have to do Insertion and Selection Sort using recursion as well. Looking forward to tomorrrow.

## day 48 : 10 January 2024

I'm 10 mins late to update the repo. Okay, I am not gonna lie, I didn't study the new topic properly today. I was actually doing yesterday's homework. And, so I wrote the code for Sleection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Bubble Sort recursively. And, Then I slacked of till 11:30 (night), and then sat down for studying as day was almost over. And, I did watch the whole video but, I couldn't grasp the concept peoperly. I think tomorrow I'm going to do it again, and solve the "Merge 2 Sorted Arrays" problem. That's it for today.

## day 49 : 11 January 2024

So, today was a long day. I properly did Merge Sort, and in the process i ended up spending 6-8 hours, because for few logical errors. I finally managed to fix them, and I can't tell how amazing it finally felt after I managed to fix the issues. So, as a result of that Merge Sort was all I could do today. And, there are some homework that I will do and tomorrow I think I'm going to start Quick Sort.

It's 11:55 at night. (made this commit just in time. üòÇ)

## day 50 : 12 January 2024

I think today, after a very long time I'm actually not running against time to study or make the commit. I generally used to make the commit a day or even two later sometimes, as I used to study late at night , after technically the day had passed, or to maintain daily commits in the repo, or sometimes I would jest be lazy about making the commit. Not, to mention all the gaps. I mean it was supposed to be 100 days of code. But, considering I started July last year, it's way past 100 days. And, I'm done with 50 days only today.

I don't know if I should cry or joke about it. üò¢üò¢

But, more importantly I'm halfway there. And, I have been terribly irregular these 50 days. Hopefully, I am more desciplined by the end of the 100 days. I have came to realize a lot of things in all these months. Figured out a lot of my mistakes, and biggest one is not wanting to solve them. Some of the times, I would exactly know what I'm doing wrong (I'm not talking about the code) and know what I should do to fix it, but, I won't do that.

But, I think the most important thing I've realized is that it's got less to do with motivation, and more with descipline. So, yeah I think atleast I now know why I want to finish my 100 days. I want to leasn DSA, but, I want to become a desciplined person while doing so. That's the important part. I know I'm very irregular and very indesciplined as I am now, but, everyone has to start somewhere... someday.

And, I think for me it's today. Atleast today is the day I'm finally writting about this.

Coming to the "WHAT I STUDIED TODAY ?", I finished Quick Sort. I sat down to study and yeah, I got got stuck i tne middle multiple times, but, I managed to finish it. I also finished yeasterday's homeworks. I have some to do today. I think I'll do that tomorrow, and then start with the next topic. I forgot the name, but, I'll do the next topic tomorrow.

> It's the completion of my 50th day, and I really want to write this (it's kinda cringe), so I'm gonna write it
>
> I may have been a test player up until now, but, oneday I'll be a T20 player as well. Just keep working hard.

## day 51 : 13 January 2024

I have completed the next lecture. It was a problem solving session although a very important one I think. I solved 2 problems today, the Subsets of an Array problem, and Subsequesnces of a String problem. Basically, now I know how to solve problems where I have to find all combinations of a Array / String or any other similar thing. So, I think I did learn a lot today. Although, I don't feel too happy about it. I got reminded that maybe right now, I'm wasting my time by doing this. Maybe I'm wasting time because I'm very slow. But, am I really wasting my time by deciding to not care about doing a job just yet. Am I really wasting my time by focusing on studying andgetting better in waht I want to do.

I can't say becoming a software engineer is my goal. It honestly isn't. I've never been able to think about in a "where do i want to work?" way. But, I am studying this and working on it everyday because one day I want to have enough understanding of computers, so that I can build one all by myself. I want to become a person who just usderstands completely how a computer works. THat's all I want. And, that's not going to be getting me a jo. But, I think while working towars it, at some point I'll have enough knowledge that I might manage to get a job at some company.

So, I going to keep continuing what I'm doing, but, I don't know what to do when someone says I'm amking a mistake and I don't have anything to proe to them that I'm not. Or, maybe, I really am making a mistake. Who knows...

## day 52 : 14 January 2024

I have completed the next lecture today. I didn't study a lot today (atleast not till now), but as I have finished today's task, i'm updating the repo. I did LeetCode - 177 (Phone Keypad Recursion Problem). I think I'm going to study other things now, after I update the repo. Also, once again I'm updating a bit late. It's almost 10'o' clock. But, I had finished studying in the afternoon itself. I didn't update the repo because I thought I'll revise the lecture once more before updating. And, well I done with that now. So, yeah that's it for today. Now, I'll continue with next lecture tomorrow. It's again a problem solving session.

## day 53 : 15 January 2024

I have done it again üò¢. I didn't update the repo on time. It's 1'o'clock, the next day. I totally forgot about updating the repo. I did finish studying very early only, but thought I'll revise again in the evening and then update the repo. And, after I revised I forgot about it. I won't do it again. üò¢üò¢

## day 54 : 17 January 2024

I didn't update the repo yesterday. So, I didn't sleep the whole night the day before, and as a result I selpt whole day yesterday. I did sit down and studied, and solved "Rat in a Maze" problem (although I'm not getting the correct reult, it's almost correct) at night, but It was past 12, so thought I'll udate the repo next day only. And, today I finished the next lecture that was about Time and Space Complexity of Recursive Algorithms. So, whith that Recursions is finally over.

Now, the thing is, I thought if I finish Recursions, I am basically not a novice anymore, I'll reach Intermediate level once I finish Recursions, but, honestly, I don't feel any difference. I feel like I was dumb before, I am going to be dumb after as well. So, IDK what to do about it. Guess, I just have to solve a lot of problems. So, yeah that's it for today. I would generally take a break as I have finished something important, but, I don't want to do anythin like that. I'm going to start OOPS straingt away, from tomorrow.

Also, I'm 20 mins late. üòì

## Update : 21 January 2024

So, I had to go out of station and I forgot my laptop at home üò¢. So, I couldn't study DSA and update the repo for the last 2-3 days. I was studying Operating Systems doring this time though. It didn't need me to write any code so. But, now I finally have my laptop so I'll update the repo today. I'm studying OOPS now.
