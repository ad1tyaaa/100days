# Logs of Round 1

> #100DaysOfCode

## day 1 : 21 july 2023

**Progress :** Started revision of C++ basics from the beginning. Wrote a few basic programs as well. And, revised a few important theory topics.

Important Topics : 
- `char` datatype (ASCII and extended ASCII representation of `char` and `unsigned char`)
- *Storing* and *Reading* positive and negative numbers in memory
- `bool` type (reprentation, and **Negation** behavior).

**Final Thought:** I've done C++ before, so this is basically revision. Mostly i only did boring stuff today, but, I'm happy for completing day1. 😌

## day 2 : 22 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Operators (including Bitwise that took some time), then moved onto conditional statements, and loops, and finally solved some 10-15 problems (easy ones) on them.

Important Topics :
- Important Bitwise Operations and their rules and tricks.

**Final Thought:** Hmmm, honestly I feel bad for today's progress. I think I covered quite less than what I intended. I also couldn't really focus very well. I have an important report that I have to work on and I spent most of the time getting scared abut how I'm going to finish it on time. 😢

## day 3 : 23 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Bitwise Shift Operators (i forgot to study it yesterday), Functions, Memory layout of C, switch statement, and solved a few basic problems of Functions. Solved an easy problem from LeetCode as well.

Important Topics :
- Result of applying `>>` (right shift operator) on **negative** numbers, (*it makes them positive numebrs*).
- Memory layout in C / C++.

**Final Thought:** So, today i think I somewhat managed to finished the intended topics, although I counldn't solve coding problems from platforms like LeedCode, etc. I wanted to solve quite a few problems, but, as I sat down for this very late, I'm probably gonna solve problems tomorrow the whole time. I'm still feeling good though, as now I have finally completed Basics of C++, and I can start Data Structures from 25th. 🙃

## day 4 : 24 july 2023

**Progress :** Solved problems from Leetcode, GFG, and CodeStudio. That's It.

**Final Thoughts :** It feels irritating when when u can't solve a problem bucause u made a mistake so small that u had to stare at the screen for 20+ mins to find it. LeetCode #7 and #1009 kind of irritated me. But, I finally managed to solve them, and all other ones too. So, I guess it wasn't that bad afterall. Tomorrow I will finally be starting DSA. And, DSA is the part that I have left in the middle a few too many times in the past. Hopefully I don't do it again this time. 🐼

> I didn't do anything for last few days... 😢
<br> I was working on that godamn project report. 😭😭😭
<br> Finally it's over, so now i'll focus on it from tomorrow again. 🫤

## day 5 : 31 july 2023

**Progress :** Started Arrays (the first data structure). Solved a few problems, and did Linear Search too. Couldn't do Binary Search today. Will do that tomorrow.

**Final Thoughts :** I'm back. Finally... <br> I ended up taking a long break, almost a week, and now, I'm starting it again. Today i did Arrays. It's still a revision so I don't find it tough really. I did till Linear search today, didn't have enought time to cover Binary Search too. Will complete that tomorrow. Honestly, I feel like shit for taking such a long break. 😣

## day 6 : 2 august 2023

**Progress :** Continued on with Arrays, and did Binary Search. Also, solved a few problems. I found out that we can use XOR operations to swap 2 numbers. I didn't know that.

Important Topics :
- Different ways to `swap()` two numbers.
- Binary Search Optimization for dealing with *overflow case*.

**Final Thoughts :** I skipped again yesterday. And, I'll have to skip the next few days as well as I'm going out of station, and I won't have my laptop. So, I'll probably be back once I return in a few days. As, for today I ended Binary Search. I wanted to do Complexity Analysis as well, but, I thought it would be better to do it after I return. I don't want to go on a break just after studying that. 🐼

## day 7 : 9 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a basic revision of Arrays, and Searching Algorithms. And started vectors. Couldn't finish vectors today.

Important Topics :
- `memset()` function
- Designated Initialization

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm, I have returned back home, and resumed DSA today. I started Vectors today, and well, I'm struggling. Not because it's tough, but, idk. I'm finding sitting and coding for more than an hour tough. I feel like stopping and watching youtube or something when I code. I initially wanted to complete Algorithm Complexity as well today, but, I couldn't sit past 1 hour mark, as I couldn't focus. How do I fix this ? 😣

## day 8 : 16 August 2023

**Progress :** Solved Coding Problems on Arrays.

**Final Thoughts :** I didn't solve too many problems, but, it felt good to be back. I am going totry my best to be consistent from now on. I solved 5 problems I think. The "Triplet Sum" and "Sort 0 1 2" i'll solve tomorrow. I got stuck in almost every problem today, but, still I think it's going to get better. 🥲
