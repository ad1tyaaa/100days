# Logs of Round 1

> #100DaysOfCode

## day 1 : 21 july 2023

**Progress :** Started revision of C++ basics from the beginning. Wrote a few basic programs as well. And, revised a few important theory topics.

Important Topics : 
- `char` datatype (ASCII and extended ASCII representation of `char` and `unsigned char`)
- *Storing* and *Reading* positive and negative numbers in memory
- `bool` type (reprentation, and **Negation** behavior).

**Final Thought:** I've done C++ before, so this is basically revision. Mostly i only did boring stuff today, but, I'm happy for completing day1. ðŸ˜Œ

## day 2 : 22 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Operators (including Bitwise that took some time), then moved onto conditional statements, and loops, and finally solved some 10-15 problems (easy ones) on them.

Important Topics : *optional*
- Important Bitwise Operations and their rules and tricks.

**Final Thought:** Hmmm, honestly I feel bad for today's progress. I think I covered quite less than what I intended. I also couldn't really focus very well. I have an important report that I have to work on and I spent most of the time getting scared abut how I'm going to finish it on time. ðŸ˜¢
