# Logs of Round 1

> #100DaysOfCode

## day 1 : 21 july 2023

**Progress :** Started revision of C++ basics from the beginning. Wrote a few basic programs as well. And, revised a few important theory topics.

Important Topics : 
- `char` datatype (ASCII and extended ASCII representation of `char` and `unsigned char`)
- *Storing* and *Reading* positive and negative numbers in memory
- `bool` type (reprentation, and **Negation** behavior).

**Final Thought:** I've done C++ before, so this is basically revision. Mostly i only did boring stuff today, but, I'm happy for completing day1. üòå

## day 2 : 22 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Operators (including Bitwise that took some time), then moved onto conditional statements, and loops, and finally solved some 10-15 problems (easy ones) on them.

Important Topics :
- Important Bitwise Operations and their rules and tricks.

**Final Thought:** Hmmm, honestly I feel bad for today's progress. I think I covered quite less than what I intended. I also couldn't really focus very well. I have an important report that I have to work on and I spent most of the time getting scared abut how I'm going to finish it on time. üò¢

## day 3 : 23 july 2023

**Progress :** Revised Bitwise Shift Operators (i forgot to study it yesterday), Functions, Memory layout of C, switch statement, and solved a few basic problems of Functions. Solved an easy problem from LeetCode as well.

Important Topics :
- Result of applying `>>` (right shift operator) on **negative** numbers, (*it makes them positive numebrs*).
- Memory layout in C / C++.

**Final Thought:** So, today i think I somewhat managed to finished the intended topics, although I counldn't solve coding problems from platforms like LeedCode, etc. I wanted to solve quite a few problems, but, as I sat down for this very late, I'm probably gonna solve problems tomorrow the whole time. I'm still feeling good though, as now I have finally completed Basics of C++, and I can start Data Structures from 25th. üôÉ

## day 4 : 24 july 2023

**Progress :** Solved problems from Leetcode, GFG, and CodeStudio. That's It.

**Final Thoughts :** It feels irritating when when u can't solve a problem bucause u made a mistake so small that u had to stare at the screen for 20+ mins to find it. LeetCode #7 and #1009 kind of irritated me. But, I finally managed to solve them, and all other ones too. So, I guess it wasn't that bad afterall. Tomorrow I will finally be starting DSA. And, DSA is the part that I have left in the middle a few too many times in the past. Hopefully I don't do it again this time. üêº

> I didn't do anything for last few days... üò¢
<br> I was working on that godamn project report. üò≠üò≠üò≠
<br> Finally it's over, so now i'll focus on it from tomorrow again. ü´§

## day 5 : 31 july 2023

**Progress :** Started Arrays (the first data structure). Solved a few problems, and did Linear Search too. Couldn't do Binary Search today. Will do that tomorrow.

**Final Thoughts :** I'm back. Finally... <br> I ended up taking a long break, almost a week, and now, I'm starting it again. Today i did Arrays. It's still a revision so I don't find it tough really. I did till Linear search today, didn't have enought time to cover Binary Search too. Will complete that tomorrow. Honestly, I feel like shit for taking such a long break. üò£

## day 6 : 2 august 2023

**Progress :** Continued on with Arrays, and did Binary Search. Also, solved a few problems. I found out that we can use XOR operations to swap 2 numbers. I didn't know that.

Important Topics :
- Different ways to `swap()` two numbers.
- Binary Search Optimization for dealing with *overflow case*.

**Final Thoughts :** I skipped again yesterday. And, I'll have to skip the next few days as well as I'm going out of station, and I won't have my laptop. So, I'll probably be back once I return in a few days. As, for today I ended Binary Search. I wanted to do Complexity Analysis as well, but, I thought it would be better to do it after I return. I don't want to go on a break just after studying that. üêº

## day 7 : 9 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a basic revision of Arrays, and Searching Algorithms. And started vectors. Couldn't finish vectors today.

Important Topics :
- `memset()` function
- Designated Initialization

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm, I have returned back home, and resumed DSA today. I started Vectors today, and well, I'm struggling. Not because it's tough, but, idk. I'm finding sitting and coding for more than an hour tough. I feel like stopping and watching youtube or something when I code. I initially wanted to complete Algorithm Complexity as well today, but, I couldn't sit past 1 hour mark, as I couldn't focus. How do I fix this ? üò£

## day 8 : 16 August 2023

**Progress :** Solved Coding Problems on Arrays.

**Final Thoughts :** I didn't solve too many problems, but, it felt good to be back. I am going totry my best to be consistent from now on. I solved 5 problems I think. The "Triplet Sum" and "Sort 0 1 2" i'll solve tomorrow. I got stuck in almost every problem today, but, still I think it's going to get better. ü•≤

## day 9 : 22 August 2023

**Progress :** Did a revision of everything I studied up until now and solved a bunch of Basic Coding Problems.

**Final Thoughts :** I solved some coding problems today, and also did a revision. Need to be consistent. üò£üò£üò£

## Update (09 September 2023)

I have slacked off for 15+ days now. This is what always ends up happening. It starts as skipping 1-2 days, and then becomes a very long time. And then, when I come back, I feel like "I can't remember anything" and "I should start from beginning, again", and the cycle repeats. What do I have to do to get out of this cycle ? üò£

But, anyway I am thinking of continuing after day 9. Maybe, I should just scrap this and start from beginning, but, I want to keep this to remind me how bad simply skipping 1-2 days can become, so I don't do it again. Of course, I know when I open Arrays, where I left, I'm going to feel like a complete Idiot who doesn't remeber anything and I'm going to want to study up until then again. So, I think I'm going to do revision for 2-3 days first, then I'll do day 10.

So, I think I am doing revision of **C++ Basics** for now. After that, I'll continue with #100DaysOfCode.

This starting to become like a journal now. Maybe I'll start writting more in this md-file from now on. Maybe that'll keep me from slacking.

But, for now, that is all.

## Revision (12 September 2023)

I have been studying basics again and I studied how really C++ works behind the scenes in depth. I got to know a lot about C++ Preprocessing, Compilation process, and Lineing etc. It's actually really interesting. I have also been solving problems. Nothing too difficult, just the ones from "Basics of C++" COding-Ninjas course. I think I'll rervise stuff till day after tomorrow and then I'll cotinue.

Well, that's it for today. I'll update later.

## Revision (18 September 2023)

I have been revising and procrastinating and so revision is over. Tomorrow I'll starrt with day10. I'll do arrays and maybe solve a few Questions. I really want to keep up this time.

## day 10 : 19 September 2023

**Progress :** Started with Arrays (again) and solved some coding problems from it too.

**Final Thoughts :** I think it's been a long time since I enjoyed getting my ass kicked by C++ so mouch üòÇ. Today I started Arrays from the beginning again. And, as I have already done it multiple times in the past, theoretically it's not something I struggle with really, but, I always feel like I am still not there, when I'm solving problems. I can't say that I have finally achieved satisfaction with my problem solving skills in Arrays (well, I got stuck in that 1 problem `3Sum` from Coding Ninjas), but, I think I definitely made some progress. I think with just a little bit more effort I'll finally start feeling satisfied with myself. But, for now, I only want to say one thing - The struggle is not over. yet.

## day 11 : 20 September 2023

**Progress :** Continued with solving coding problems in Arrays. Actually I only solved 2 problems. They took a few hours actually.

**Final Thoughts :** Hmmm. `Sort 0 1 2` is easy but, how do I say this... there was one really interesting method to solve it, and one very dumb method to solve it. I spent like half an hour on the interesting method, and got TLE, and the dumb one worked just fine üò¢. So, basically, I GOT SCAMMED. Apart from that, I solved `3Sum` from Coding Ninjas as well. I managed to solve it although all testcases didn't pass. It ended up taking 2-3+ hours, and there were a few issues in my logic. I finally managed to finish it, but got TLE in some testcases. I think I'm gonna leave that problem at that. When I learn a few new things I will come back to it I guess. So, yeah that's it for today. I just saw the time, and it's already past 12, and I hadn't updated the repo with day11's progress, so I am doing it now. But, I actually plan to solve two problems from LeetCode too, before I go to sleep. I hope it doesn't take too long.
