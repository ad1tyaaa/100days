# Logs of Round 1

> #100DaysOfCode

## day 1 : 21 july 2023

**Progress :** Started revision of C++ basics from the beginning. Wrote a few basic programs as well. And, revised a few important theory topics.

Important Topics : 
- `char` datatype (ASCII and extended ASCII representation of `char` and `unsigned char`)
- *Storing* and *Reading* positive and negative numbers in memory
- `bool` type (reprentation, and **Negation** behavior).

**Final Thought:** I've done C++ before, so this is basically revision. Mostly i only did boring stuff today, but, I'm happy for completing day1. ðŸ˜Œ
